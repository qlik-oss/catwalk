Gain data model insights quickly during its development and validation phases. This tool is useful when you want to explore your data model for whatever reason; maybe you are creating a complex load script, maybe you want to investigate associations.

# Usage

For catwalk to work there are two things needed:
1. The UI
2. A Qlik Associative Engine app

## 1. UI

## Hosted

You can use catwalk from [catwalk.core.qlik.com](https://catwalk.core.qlik.com), it will have the latest master build deployed and can also be used against an local Qlik Associative Engine.

## Local

If you want to run/develop the UI locally, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then run these commands in Git Bash/command prompt/terminal and follow the instructions on your screen:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qlik-oss/catwalk.git
cd catwalk
npm install
npm start
```

## 2. Qlik Associative Engine
You need to provide catwalk with a websocket URL to the app.  

### Example App
For convenience there is an example app and docker-compose.yml in the catwalk repository
```bash
ACCEPT_EULA=yes docker-compose up -d
```
The docker-compose.yml in the repository will expose the Qlik Associative Engine app at:

`ws://localhost:9076/data/drugcases.qvf`

### Qlik Sense Desktop
For connecting to a Qlik Sense Desktop the websocket URL will be:

`ws://localhost:4848/app/<app-name>`

### Qlik Sense Enterprise
The catwalk UI doesn't provide login to the Qlik Sense app but as long as there has been a login to the app in another tab/window the `X-Qlik-Session` cookie is set and catwalk can "reuse" that session. The URL [catwalk.core.qlik.com](https://catwalk.core.qlik.com) has to be white listed in the QMC -> virtual proxy (per virtual proxy being used) for the Sense Proxy to allow sessions from catwalk.

### Tip 1:tada:
We created a Qlik Sense extension that can be found in the sense-extension folder that will create a link to the Qlik hosted catwalk UI with the current open app if "dragged" onto a sheet of you Qlik Sense app.
To install the extension you have to zip the folder and import it into you Qlik Sense installation, [see](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/November2018/Subsystems/Extensions/Content/Sense_Extensions/Howtos/deploy-extensions.htm)

### Tip 2:tada:
We created a javascript bookmark that can be found in the [bookmark](./bookmark) folder that will open up a new tab to the Qlik hosted catwalk UI with the current open app.
To setup Create a bookmark and paste the content of [bookmark.js](./bookmark/bookmark.js) in the URL field.
