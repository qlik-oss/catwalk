# User insights

## Why do we focus on user insights

*We want to make developers awesome!* We believe that offering robust, efficient and capable tools enabling the user to
create awesome solutions with the Qlik Associative engine will get us there.

While we are gathering feedback from a selected few, we would also like to understand what most users are facing. What
system do they develop on, what issues do they have and what opinions do they have. The following table describes what
we would like to achieve and why.

What do we want to know? | Why do we want to know? | What signals this?
