# User insights

## Why do we focus on user insights

*We want to make developers awesome!* We believe that offering robust, efficient and capable tools enabling the user to
create awesome solutions with the Qlik Associative engine will get us there.

While we are gathering feedback from a selected few, we would also like to understand what most users are facing. What
system do they develop on, what issues do they have and what opinions do they have. The following table describes what
we would like to achieve and why.

Prio | What do we want to know? | Why do we want to know? | What signals this?
-----| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------
1 | User data - who are our users | To know who we should support. To understand who we miss out. To see the uptake of the tool | Google analytics data
2 | What exceptions and bugs occurs in live usage | To improve the user experience. To find bugs in production |  Google analtyics
3 | Tool performance (time) | To increase user satisfaction |  Test in the dev environment
4 | How well does the user understand the tool (different concepts) | We would like to give a solution which helps the users in an as good way as possible | Helpfull / not helpfull button on informatin popups
X | Size of the datamodel    | Understand the user's needs => insight in UX- and performance requirements |  
X | What features gives value | We want to deliver features with the most value |  
X | What problem does the user have | To increase user satisfaction |  
X | What version the user are running on (catwalk, corectl, engine) | Understand version uptake and   where issues occurs. | Google analytics data
X | Number of iterations in data nmodelling using catwalk before reaching a solution | Understand how the user works with load scripting and data modeling. How much time is spent checking the datamodel with catwalk vs fixing directly in the script
